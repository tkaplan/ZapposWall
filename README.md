ZapposWall
==========

Objective: Build a web app that allows a user to--
  1) Create an account
  2) Authenticate
  3) Post on global wall that everyone shares
  4) Log out

This is a simple Spring MVC Web App that I built for my Zappos resume. Since it is my first jab at Spring MVC
this is kind of like a personal 5 day hackathon.
